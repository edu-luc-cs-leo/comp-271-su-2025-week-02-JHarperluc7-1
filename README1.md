# Week 2 Journal

# What is Similar

- Both versions use an array 
- both have a method to find and remove the smallest element
- We both have a method to add a new value
- Both versions print out the array before and after removing the smallest value

# What Could be Improved On Or Is Diff.

- I added extra versions of the getSmallest() to handle empty arrays 
- I wrote a lot of comments

- The professor’s version is more direct

- Make sure class variables are private.
- Use named constants 
- Maybe think about pulling out repeated logic when seen


# General Thoughts

I'm trying to balance a lot right now between work and class, but I care about doing this right. Even when things feel a little chaotic, I want to be consistent and honest with myself and my work. I need to focus on how small details — like making something `private` or handling empty arrays — really matter in code.
